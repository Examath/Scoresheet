Scoresheet is designed to help tabulate individual and team scores for large, complex compeditive events. Scoresheet can automate several tasks including handling registrations for solo and group competition items, tabulating and averaging scores given by multiple judges, determining winners and finally generating certificates for all participants.

See the [releases](https://github.com/Examath/Scoresheet/releases) to download the latest version. Example scoresheets and templates are available [here](https://github.com/Examath/Scoresheet/tree/master/Examples).

Please contact me if you would like scoresheet tailored to your event.
